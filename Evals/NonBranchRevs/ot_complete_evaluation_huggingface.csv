What Dimitrios say about heavy slow resistance program for elbow pain?,"['Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition that is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- condyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- tis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis. The definitions referring epicondylitis and periositis are discontinued over time. These descriptions were likely indicated an inflamma- tory origin. 2 , 3 Under chronic conditions, the affected tissue gen- erally lacked inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils). 4 In chronic cases, the problem was often degenera- tion origined and angiofibroblastic hyperplasia was the proof of immature tissue repair. For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- tis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 Range-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, and functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- ment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- ercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit. However, it is still unknown whether the stretching should be static or ballistic, also the issue of selection in isometric or isotonic strengthening exercises still persists in this area. 1 , 2 Viswas et al claimed that ec- centric exercises were better for pain management and function- ality in tendinopathies. 6 Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow resistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric exercises. It is hypothesized to be more beneficial than only eccen- tric training in management of pain and function in LET. 7 All the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- der to carry out the activities of daily living. Otherwise, upper ex- tremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- rioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, there isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about the management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. In the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be modified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- tients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an appropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in movement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints which in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the pain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we planned a graded exercise model.

Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured \nadvanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- \ntensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.\n\n\nMaterials and methods \nA prospective case series study was conducted on patients with \nLET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- \nthorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- \nmatology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- \nnations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. \nThey signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the \nethical committee of a Public Hospital. \nPatients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between \n30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this \ndiagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast \na year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. \nIn the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of \nlateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- \ntion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test \nand Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, \nultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a \nconfirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted \nby a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants \nwere outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages \n4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- \ntis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients \nwith NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- \ngram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients \nwho are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- \nsia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal \nnerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel \nsyndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, \nthe initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- \njection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy \nintervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral \nelbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 \nIntervention \nInitially, all groups received basic exercise program for four \nweeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by \na physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. \nEquipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one \nkilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a \ntowel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- \ngrams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of \nfour weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- \nical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- \nsion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook \nand were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications \nthere was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- \nration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- \ning physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical \npractice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- \nfession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their \nadvanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two \nexercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. \nAdditionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- \ntient education was given to teach how to act during any work \nactivity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- \nsition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the \nproper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit \nof load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 \nBasic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of \na warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- \noriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were \napplied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- \never, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were \nallowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing \nprocess. \nAdvanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, \nwe determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- \nening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might \ncreate discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four \nweeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that \nthese exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After \nbasic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- \nening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- \ntients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- \ntion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor \nmuscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times \na day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- \nening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- \nband according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises \nexisting in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with \nconcentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- \ntients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- \nother four weeks. \nOutcome measurement \nPain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the \nlevel of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and \ngrip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- \nformed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. \n\n\n\nPain \nVisual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, \nduring rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with \nzero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 \nPain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a \nBaseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- \nterprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter \nwas adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The \ndiameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society \nof Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip \nstrength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow \nat an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- \nues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used \nin the analyses. 22 \nStatistical analyses \nAll the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- \nage for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive \nstatistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). \nNPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after \neach grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk \ntest was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was \nfound to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was \nused for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used \nfor statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises \ncomparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect \nsize was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES \nof 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values \nlower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of \nthe analysis results. \nResults \nThirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. \nThirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were \nincluded. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, \nnine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients \nbelonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- \ncise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed \nrespectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), \ntwo (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- \npants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was \nnot planned for two people who took place, they were stage one \nand two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic \nexercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study \n( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight \npatients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit \nin the advanced exercise program. After advanced exercises, dis- \ntribution of patientsâ€™ pain stages according to NPS was changed \nto respectively to values zero (three participants), one (two par- \nticipants), two (11 participants), three (12 participants). The demo- \ngraphic data of the participants are presented in Table 1 . The mean \nage and body mass index were similar in both groups, also all the \nparticipants were right-handed. \nAccording to the pain in VAS and in PPT scores, after basic \nexercise, patients had a lower score than before treatment in- \ndicating improvement (VAS-Activity p > 0.001, ES = 1.35; VAS- \nRest p = 0.007, ES = 0.72; VAS-night p > 0.001, ES = 0.73; \nPPT p = 0.002, ES = 0.91). Additionally, a significant decrease \nin VAS and PPT scores were found after advanced exercise in \npatients with LET (VAS-Activity p = 0.005, ES = 1.73; VAS-Rest \np = 0.01, ES = 1.00; VAS-Night p = 0.01, ES = 1.03; PPT p = 0.002\n\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\Burn treatment.html', 'title': 'Hand Burn Treatment for Occupational Therapists', '_id': 'cb40acf2aa4b4f148255f78710bfed63', '_collection_name': 'OT'}, page_content='\n\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment for Occupational Therapists\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment Guide\nInitial Care: Cool the burn with lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes.

What lateral elbow tendinopathy?,"['Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition that is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- condyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- tis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis. The definitions referring epicondylitis and periositis are discontinued over time.

It affects the soft tissues, specifically the tendons, with the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis tendon commonly involved. Previously described terms like epicondylitis or periostitis, which suggested an inflammatory origin, have been mostly replaced by ""tendinopathy"" due to a lack of inflammatory cells in chronic cases. The condition is often associated with tendon degeneration and imperfect tissue repair. Treatment typically involves exercises focusing on range of motion, stretching, and strengthening, along with pain management strategies.","[Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\Tennis elbow graded exercise.html', 'title': '', '_id': '41196ba9cebe4772baa773e752def539', '_collection_name': 'OT'}, page_content='\n\n\n\n\nLateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition \nthat is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- \ncondyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- \ntis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis.

Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured \nadvanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- \ntensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.\n\n\nMaterials and methods \nA prospective case series study was conducted on patients with \nLET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- \nthorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- \nmatology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- \nnations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. \nThey signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the \nethical committee of a Public Hospital. \nPatients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between \n30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this \ndiagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast \na year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. \nIn the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of \nlateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- \ntion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test \nand Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, \nultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a \nconfirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted \nby a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants \nwere outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages \n4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- \ntis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients \nwith NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- \ngram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients \nwho are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- \nsia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal \nnerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel \nsyndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, \nthe initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- \njection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy \nintervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral \nelbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 \nIntervention \nInitially, all groups received basic exercise program for four \nweeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by \na physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. \nEquipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one \nkilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a \ntowel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- \ngrams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of \nfour weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- \nical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- \nsion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook \nand were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications \nthere was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- \nration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- \ning physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical \npractice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- \nfession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their \nadvanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two \nexercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. \nAdditionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- \ntient education was given to teach how to act during any work \nactivity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- \nsition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the \nproper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit \nof load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 \nBasic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of \na warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- \noriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were \napplied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- \never, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were \nallowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing \nprocess. \nAdvanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, \nwe determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- \nening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might \ncreate discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four \nweeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that \nthese exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After \nbasic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- \nening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- \ntients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- \ntion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor \nmuscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times \na day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- \nening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- \nband according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises \nexisting in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with \nconcentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- \ntients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- \nother four weeks. \nOutcome measurement \nPain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the \nlevel of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and \ngrip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- \nformed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. \n\n\n\nPain \nVisual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, \nduring rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with \nzero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 \nPain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a \nBaseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- \nterprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter \nwas adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The \ndiameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society \nof Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip \nstrength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow \nat an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- \nues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used \nin the analyses. 22 \nStatistical analyses \nAll the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- \nage for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive \nstatistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). \nNPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after \neach grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk \ntest was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was \nfound to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was \nused for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used \nfor statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises \ncomparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect \nsize was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES \nof 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values \nlower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of \nthe analysis results. \nResults \nThirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. \nThirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were \nincluded. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, \nnine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients \nbelonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- \ncise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed \nrespectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), \ntwo (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- \npants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was \nnot planned for two people who took place, they were stage one \nand two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic \nexercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study \n( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight \npatients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit \nin the advanced exercise program.

Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter \nwas adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The \ndiameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society \nof Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip \nstrength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow \nat an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- \nues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used \nin the analyses. 22 \nStatistical analyses \nAll the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- \nage for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive \nstatistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). \nNPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after \neach grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk \ntest was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was \nfound to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was \nused for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used \nfor statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises \ncomparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect \nsize was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES \nof 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values \nlower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of \nthe analysis results. \nResults \nThirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. \nThirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were \nincluded. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, \nnine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients \nbelonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- \ncise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed \nrespectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), \ntwo (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- \npants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was \nnot planned for two people who took place, they were stage one \nand two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic \nexercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study \n( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight \npatients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit \nin the advanced exercise program. After advanced exercises, dis- \ntribution of patientsâ€™ pain stages according to NPS was changed \nto respectively to values zero (three participants), one (two par- \nticipants), two (11 participants), three (12 participants). The demo- \ngraphic data of the participants are presented in Table 1 . The mean \nage and body mass index were similar in both groups, also all the \nparticipants were right-handed. \nAccording to the pain in VAS and in PPT scores, after basic \nexercise, patients had a lower score than before treatment in- \ndicating improvement (VAS-Activity p > 0.001, ES = 1.35; VAS- \nRest p = 0.007, ES = 0.72; VAS-night p > 0.001, ES = 0.73; \nPPT p = 0.002, ES = 0.91). Additionally, a significant decrease \nin VAS and PPT scores were found after advanced exercise in \npatients with LET (VAS-Activity p = 0.005, ES = 1.73; VAS-Rest \np = 0.01, ES = 1.00; VAS-Night p = 0.01, ES = 1.03; PPT p = 0.002\n\n', '\n\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment for Occupational Therapists\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment Guide\nInitial Care: Cool the burn with lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes.

What is the Minimal Clinical Important Difference for VAS Score aimed for in the progression of patients with lateral epicondylitis?,"['Materials and methods A prospective case series study was conducted on patients with LET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- thorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- matology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- nations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. They signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the ethical committee of a Public Hospital. Patients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between 30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this diagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast a year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. In the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- tion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test and Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, ultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a confirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted by a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants were outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages 4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- tis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients with NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- gram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients who are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- sia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal nerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel syndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, the initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- jection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy intervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral elbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 Intervention Initially, all groups received basic exercise program for four weeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by a physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. Equipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one kilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a towel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- grams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of four weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- ical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- sion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook and were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications there was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- ration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- ing physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical practice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- fession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their advanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two exercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. Additionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- tient education was given to teach how to act during any work activity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- sition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the proper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit of load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 Basic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of a warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- oriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were applied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- ever, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were allowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing process. Advanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, we determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- ening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might create discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four weeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that these exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After basic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- ening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- tients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- tion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor muscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times a day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- ening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- band according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises existing in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- tients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- other four weeks.']","At the end of four weeks of basic treatment, a three-unit decrease (Minimal Clinical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progression.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,The Minimal Clinical Important Difference for VAS Score aimed for in the progression of patients with lateral epicondylitis is a three-unit decrease.,"[Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\Tennis elbow graded exercise.html', 'title': '', '_id': '41196ba9cebe4772baa773e752def539', '_collection_name': 'OT'}, page_content='\n\n\n\n\nLateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition \nthat is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- \ncondyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- \ntis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis.

For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- \ntis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 \nRange-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, \nand functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- \nment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- \nercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit.

The pain causes alterations in \nmovement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints \nwhich in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the \npain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we \nplanned a graded exercise model.

The transition to the advanced program \nis decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS \nactivity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise \nprogram consists of stretching along with both concentric and \neccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more \nbenefit would be obtained because of the transition between two \ngrades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of \npatients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine \nthe effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- \ntus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table \n2 ).

The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table.

The exclusion criteria were neopla- \nsia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal \nnerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel \nsyndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, \nthe initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- \njection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy \nintervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral \nelbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 \nIntervention \nInitially, all groups received basic exercise program for four \nweeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by \na physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. \nEquipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one \nkilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a \ntowel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- \ngrams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of \nfour weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- \nical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- \nsion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook \nand were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications \nthere was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- \nration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- \ning physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical \npractice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- \nfession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their \nadvanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two \nexercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. \nAdditionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- \ntient education was given to teach how to act during any work \nactivity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- \nsition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the \nproper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit \nof load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 \nBasic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of \na warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- \noriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were \napplied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- \never, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were \nallowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing \nprocess. \nAdvanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, \nwe determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- \nening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might \ncreate discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four \nweeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that \nthese exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After \nbasic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- \nening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- \ntients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- \ntion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor \nmuscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times \na day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- \nening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- \nband according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises \nexisting in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with \nconcentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- \ntients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- \nother four weeks. \nOutcome measurement \nPain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the \nlevel of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and \ngrip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- \nformed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. \n\n\n\nPain \nVisual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, \nduring rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with \nzero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 \nPain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a \nBaseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- \nterprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter \nwas adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The \ndiameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society \nof Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip \nstrength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow \nat an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- \nues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used \nin the analyses. 22 \nStatistical analyses \nAll the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- \nage for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive \nstatistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). \nNPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after \neach grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk \ntest was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was \nfound to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was \nused for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used \nfor statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises \ncomparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect \nsize was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES \nof 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values \nlower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of \nthe analysis results. \nResults \nThirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. \nThirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were \nincluded. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, \nnine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients \nbelonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- \ncise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed \nrespectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), \ntwo (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- \npants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was \nnot planned for two people who took place, they were stage one \nand two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic \nexercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study \n( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight \npatients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit \nin the advanced exercise program. After advanced exercises, dis- \ntribution of patientsâ€™ pain stages according to NPS was changed \nto respectively to values zero (three participants), one (two par- \nticipants), two (11 participants), three (12 participants). The demo- \ngraphic data of the participants are presented in Table 1 . The mean \nage and body mass index were similar in both groups, also all the \nparticipants were right-handed. \nAccording to the pain in VAS and in PPT scores, after basic \nexercise, patients had a lower score than before treatment in- \ndicating improvement (VAS-Activity p > 0.001, ES = 1.35; VAS- \nRest p = 0.007, ES = 0.72; VAS-night p > 0.001, ES = 0.73; \nPPT p = 0.002, ES = 0.91). Additionally, a significant decrease \nin VAS and PPT scores were found after advanced exercise in \npatients with LET (VAS-Activity p = 0.005, ES = 1.73; VAS-Rest \np = 0.01, ES = 1.00; VAS-Night p = 0.01, ES = 1.03; PPT p = 0.002\n\n', '\n\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment for Occupational Therapists\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment Guide\nInitial Care: Cool the burn with lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes.

What is the Mills Test used for in diagnosing lateral epicondylitis?,"['Materials and methods A prospective case series study was conducted on patients with LET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- thorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- matology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- nations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. They signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the ethical committee of a Public Hospital. Patients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between 30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this diagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast a year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. In the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- tion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test and Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, ultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a confirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted by a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants were outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages 4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- tis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients with NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- gram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients who are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- sia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal nerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel syndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, the initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- jection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy intervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral elbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 Intervention Initially, all groups received basic exercise program for four weeks, three times a week.

It is a clinical test performed by an orthopedist as part of a physical examination. While the context you provided does not detail the specific procedure of the Mills Test, generally, it involves extending the patient's elbow, pronating the forearm, and flexing the wrist. Pain experienced in the lateral epicondyle area during this maneuver is indicative of lateral epicondylitis.","[Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\Tennis elbow graded exercise.html', 'title': '', '_id': '41196ba9cebe4772baa773e752def539', '_collection_name': 'OT'}, page_content='\n\n\n\n\nLateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition \nthat is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- \ncondyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- \ntis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis. The \ndefinitions referring epicondylitis and periositis are discontinued \nover time. These descriptions were likely indicated an inflamma- \ntory origin. 2 , 3 Under chronic conditions, the affected tissue gen- \nerally lacked inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, and\nneutrophils). 4 In chronic cases, the problem was often degenera- \ntion origined and angiofibroblastic hyperplasia was the proof of \nimmature tissue repair. For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- \ntis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 \nRange-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, \nand functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- \nment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- \nercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit. However, it is \nstill unknown whether the stretching should be static or ballistic, \nalso the issue of selection in isometric or isotonic strengthening \nexercises still persists in this area. 1 , 2 Viswas et al claimed that ec- \ncentric exercises were better for pain management and function- \nality in tendinopathies. 6 Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow \nresistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric \nexercises. It is hypothesized to be more beneficial than only eccen- \ntric training in management of pain and function in LET. 7 \nAll the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- \nder to carry out the activities of daily living. Otherwise, upper ex- \ntremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- \nrioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, \nthere isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about \nthe management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. \nIn the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be \nmodified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- \ntients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an \nappropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in \nmovement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints \nwhich in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the \npain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we \nplanned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised \ngraded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- \nsue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our \nexercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded \nmanner. 8 \nIn the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric \nstrengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively \nnamed as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program \nis decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS \nactivity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise \nprogram consists of stretching along with both concentric and \neccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more \nbenefit would be obtained because of the transition between two \ngrades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of \npatients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine \nthe effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- \ntus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table \n2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured \nadvanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- \ntensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.\n\n\nMaterials and methods \nA prospective case series study was conducted on patients with \nLET.

For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- \ntis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 \nRange-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, \nand functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- \nment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- \nercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit. However, it is \nstill unknown whether the stretching should be static or ballistic, \nalso the issue of selection in isometric or isotonic strengthening \nexercises still persists in this area. 1 , 2 Viswas et al claimed that ec- \ncentric exercises were better for pain management and function- \nality in tendinopathies. 6 Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow \nresistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric \nexercises. It is hypothesized to be more beneficial than only eccen- \ntric training in management of pain and function in LET. 7 \nAll the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- \nder to carry out the activities of daily living. Otherwise, upper ex- \ntremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- \nrioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, \nthere isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about \nthe management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. \nIn the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be \nmodified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- \ntients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an \nappropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in \nmovement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints \nwhich in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the \npain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we \nplanned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised \ngraded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- \nsue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our \nexercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded \nmanner. 8 \nIn the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric \nstrengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively \nnamed as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program \nis decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS \nactivity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise \nprogram consists of stretching along with both concentric and \neccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more \nbenefit would be obtained because of the transition between two \ngrades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of \npatients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine \nthe effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- \ntus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table \n2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured \nadvanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- \ntensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.\n\n\nMaterials and methods \nA prospective case series study was conducted on patients with \nLET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- \nthorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- \nmatology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- \nnations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. \nThey signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the \nethical committee of a Public Hospital. \nPatients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between \n30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this \ndiagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast \na year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. \nIn the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of \nlateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- \ntion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test \nand Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, \nultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a \nconfirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted \nby a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants \nwere outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages \n4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- \ntis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients \nwith NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- \ngram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients \nwho are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- \nsia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal \nnerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel \nsyndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, \nthe initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- \njection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy \nintervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral \nelbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 \nIntervention \nInitially, all groups received basic exercise program for four \nweeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by \na physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. \nEquipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one \nkilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a \ntowel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- \ngrams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of \nfour weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- \nical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- \nsion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook \nand were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications \nthere was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- \nration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- \ning physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical \npractice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- \nfession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their \nadvanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two \nexercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. \nAdditionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- \ntient education was given to teach how to act during any work \nactivity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- \nsition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the \nproper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit \nof load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 \nBasic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of \na warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- \noriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were \napplied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- \never, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were \nallowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing \nprocess. \nAdvanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, \nwe determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- \nening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might \ncreate discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four \nweeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that \nthese exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After \nbasic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- \nening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- \ntients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- \ntion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor \nmuscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times \na day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- \nening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- \nband according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises \nexisting in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with \nconcentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- \ntients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- \nother four weeks. \nOutcome measurement \nPain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the \nlevel of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and \ngrip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- \nformed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. \n\n\n\nPain \nVisual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, \nduring rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with \nzero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 \nPain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a \nBaseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- \nterprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter \nwas adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The \ndiameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society \nof Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip \nstrength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow \nat an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- \nues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used \nin the analyses. 22 \nStatistical analyses \nAll the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- \nage for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive \nstatistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). \nNPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after \neach grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk \ntest was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was \nfound to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was \nused for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used \nfor statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises \ncomparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect \nsize was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES \nof 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values \nlower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of \nthe analysis results. \nResults \nThirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. \nThirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were \nincluded. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, \nnine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients \nbelonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- \ncise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed \nrespectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), \ntwo (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- \npants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was \nnot planned for two people who took place, they were stage one \nand two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic \nexercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study \n( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight \npatients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit \nin the advanced exercise program. After advanced exercises, dis- \ntribution of patientsâ€™ pain stages according to NPS was changed \nto respectively to values zero (three participants), one (two par- \nticipants), two (11 participants), three (12 participants). The demo- \ngraphic data of the participants are presented in Table 1 . The mean \nage and body mass index were similar in both groups, also all the \nparticipants were right-handed. \nAccording to the pain in VAS and in PPT scores, after basic \nexercise, patients had a lower score than before treatment in- \ndicating improvement (VAS-Activity p > 0.001, ES = 1.35; VAS- \nRest p = 0.007, ES = 0.72; VAS-night p > 0.001, ES = 0.73; \nPPT p = 0.002, ES = 0.91). Additionally, a significant decrease \nin VAS and PPT scores were found after advanced exercise in \npatients with LET (VAS-Activity p = 0.005, ES = 1.73; VAS-Rest \np = 0.01, ES = 1.00; VAS-Night p = 0.01, ES = 1.03; PPT p = 0.002\n\n', '\n\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment for Occupational Therapists\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment Guide\nInitial Care: Cool the burn with lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes.

Avoid ice, as it can worsen tissue damage. Cover the burn with a sterile, non-adherent dressing.\nWound Care: Keep the area clean and dry. Use prescribed topical antimicrobial ointments. Monitor for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus.\nPain Management: Use prescribed pain relievers and consider elevation to reduce swelling. Encourage gentle range-of-motion exercises as tolerated.\nSplinting: If needed, apply a splint to maintain functional positioning and prevent contractures. Avoid excessive pressure on healing tissue.\nEdema Control: Elevate the hand above heart level, use compression wraps if indicated, and perform retrograde massage as needed.\nRange of Motion & Strengthening: Begin gentle active and passive exercises early to prevent stiffness. Progress to strengthening as healing permits.\nScar Management: Once healed, use silicone gel sheets, massage, and stretching to minimize scar formation and improve flexibility.\nPatient Education: Teach proper skincare, sun protection, and home exercises to maintain mobility and function.\n\n', '\n\n\n\n\nLateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition \nthat is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- \ncondyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- \ntis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis. The \ndefinitions referring epicondylitis and periositis are discontinued \nover time. These descriptions were likely indicated an inflamma- \ntory origin. 2 , 3 Under chronic conditions, the affected tissue gen- \nerally lacked inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, and\nneutrophils). 4 In chronic cases, the problem was often degenera- \ntion origined and angiofibroblastic hyperplasia was the proof of \nimmature tissue repair. For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- \ntis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 \nRange-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, \nand functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- \nment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- \nercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit. However, it is \nstill unknown whether the stretching should be static or ballistic, \nalso the issue of selection in isometric or isotonic strengthening \nexercises still persists in this area. 1 , 2 Viswas et al claimed that ec- \ncentric exercises were better for pain management and function- \nality in tendinopathies. 6 Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow \nresistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric \nexercises. It is hypothesized to be more beneficial than only eccen- \ntric training in management of pain and function in LET. 7 \nAll the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- \nder to carry out the activities of daily living. Otherwise, upper ex- \ntremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- \nrioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, \nthere isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about \nthe management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. \nIn the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be \nmodified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- \ntients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an \nappropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in \nmovement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints \nwhich in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the \npain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we \nplanned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised \ngraded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- \nsue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our \nexercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded \nmanner. 8 \nIn the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric \nstrengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively \nnamed as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program \nis decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS \nactivity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise \nprogram consists of stretching along with both concentric and \neccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more \nbenefit would be obtained because of the transition between two \ngrades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of \npatients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine \nthe effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- \ntus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table \n2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured \nadvanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- \ntensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.\n\n\nMaterials and methods \nA prospective case series study was conducted on patients with \nLET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- \nthorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- \nmatology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- \nnations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. \nThey signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the \nethical committee of a Public Hospital. \nPatients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between \n30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this \ndiagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast \na year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. \nIn the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of \nlateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- \ntion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test \nand Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, \nultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a \nconfirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted \nby a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants \nwere outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages \n4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- \ntis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients \nwith NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- \ngram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients \nwho are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- \nsia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal \nnerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel \nsyndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, \nthe initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- \njection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy \nintervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral \nelbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 \nIntervention \nInitially, all groups received basic exercise program for four \nweeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by \na physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. \nEquipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one \nkilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a \ntowel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- \ngrams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of \nfour weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- \nical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- \nsion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook \nand were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications \nthere was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- \nration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- \ning physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical \npractice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- \nfession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their \nadvanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two \nexercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. \nAdditionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- \ntient education was given to teach how to act during any work \nactivity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- \nsition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the \nproper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit \nof load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 \nBasic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of \na warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- \noriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were \napplied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- \never, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were \nallowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing \nprocess. \nAdvanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, \nwe determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- \nening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might \ncreate discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four \nweeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that \nthese exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After \nbasic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- \nening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- \ntients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- \ntion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor \nmuscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times \na day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- \nening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- \nband according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises \nexisting in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with \nconcentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- \ntients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- \nother four weeks. \nOutcome measurement \nPain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the \nlevel of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and \ngrip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- \nformed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. \n\n\n\nPain \nVisual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, \nduring rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with \nzero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 \nPain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a \nBaseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- \nterprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement.

The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear \nresponse to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 \nlb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants \nat the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- \nder at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, \nand hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were \ntaken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of \npain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 \nLevel of function \nPatient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- \nple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- \ntion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral \nepicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- \nlished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 \nand was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The \nTurkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- \nported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. \nThe first part includes five questions investigating the pain status \nand the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of \nfunction in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) \nduring the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a \n0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE \nscores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P \n(pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. \nGrip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline \nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- \nton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter \nwas adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The \ndiameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society \nof Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip \nstrength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow \nat an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- \nues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used \nin the analyses. 22 \nStatistical analyses \nAll the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- \nage for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive \nstatistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). \nNPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after \neach grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk \ntest was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was \nfound to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was \nused for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used \nfor statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises \ncomparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect \nsize was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES \nof 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values \nlower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of \nthe analysis results. \nResults \nThirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. \nThirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were \nincluded. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, \nnine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients \nbelonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- \ncise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed \nrespectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), \ntwo (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- \npants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was \nnot planned for two people who took place, they were stage one \nand two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic \nexercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study \n( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight \npatients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit \nin the advanced exercise program. After advanced exercises, dis- \ntribution of patientsâ€™ pain stages according to NPS was changed \nto respectively to values zero (three participants), one (two par- \nticipants), two (11 participants), three (12 participants). The demo- \ngraphic data of the participants are presented in Table 1 . The mean \nage and body mass index were similar in both groups, also all the \nparticipants were right-handed. \nAccording to the pain in VAS and in PPT scores, after basic \nexercise, patients had a lower score than before treatment in- \ndicating improvement (VAS-Activity p > 0.001, ES = 1.35; VAS- \nRest p = 0.007, ES = 0.72; VAS-night p > 0.001, ES = 0.73; \nPPT p = 0.002, ES = 0.91). Additionally, a significant decrease \nin VAS and PPT scores were found after advanced exercise in \npatients with LET (VAS-Activity p = 0.005, ES = 1.73; VAS-Rest \np = 0.01, ES = 1.00; VAS-Night p = 0.01, ES = 1.03; PPT p = 0.002\n\n')]","['\n\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment for Occupational Therapists\n\n\nHand Burn Treatment Guide\nInitial Care: Cool the burn with lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes. Avoid ice, as it can worsen tissue damage. Cover the burn with a sterile, non-adherent dressing.\nWound Care: Keep the area clean and dry. Use prescribed topical antimicrobial ointments. Monitor for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus.\nPain Management: Use prescribed pain relievers and consider elevation to reduce swelling. Encourage gentle range-of-motion exercises as tolerated.\nSplinting: If needed, apply a splint to maintain functional positioning and prevent contractures. Avoid excessive pressure on healing tissue.\nEdema Control: Elevate the hand above heart level, use compression wraps if indicated, and perform retrograde massage as needed.\nRange of Motion & Strengthening: Begin gentle active and passive exercises early to prevent stiffness. Progress to strengthening as healing permits.\nScar Management: Once healed, use silicone gel sheets, massage, and stretching to minimize scar formation and improve flexibility.\nPatient Education: Teach proper skincare, sun protection, and home exercises to maintain mobility and function.\n\n', '\n\n\n\n\nLateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition \nthat is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- \ncondyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- \ntis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis. The \ndefinitions referring epicondylitis and periositis are discontinued \nover time. These descriptions were likely indicated an inflamma- \ntory origin. 2 , 3 Under chronic conditions, the affected tissue gen- \nerally lacked inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, and\nneutrophils). 4 In chronic cases, the problem was often degenera- \ntion origined and angiofibroblastic hyperplasia was the proof of \nimmature tissue repair. For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- \ntis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 \nRange-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, \nand functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- \nment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- \nercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit. However, it is \nstill unknown whether the stretching should be static or ballistic, \nalso the issue of selection in isometric or isotonic strengthening \nexercises still persists in this area. 1 , 2 Viswas et al claimed that ec- \ncentric exercises were better for pain management and function- \nality in tendinopathies. 6 Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow \nresistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric \nexercises. It is hypothesized to be more beneficial than only eccen- \ntric training in management of pain and function in LET. 7 \nAll the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- \nder to carry out the activities of daily living. Otherwise, upper ex- \ntremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- \nrioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, \nthere isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about \nthe management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. \nIn the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be \nmodified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- \ntients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an \nappropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in \nmovement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints \nwhich in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the \npain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we \nplanned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised \ngraded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- \nsue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our \nexercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded \nmanner. 8 \nIn the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric \nstrengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively \nnamed as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program \nis decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS \nactivity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise \nprogram consists of stretching along with both concentric and \neccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more \nbenefit would be obtained because of the transition between two \ngrades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of \npatients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine \nthe effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- \ntus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table \n2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured \nadvanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- \ntensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.\n\n\nMaterials and methods \nA prospective case series study was conducted on patients with \nLET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- \nthorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- \nmatology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- \nnations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. \nThey signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the \nethical committee of a Public Hospital. \nPatients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between \n30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this \ndiagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast \na year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. \nIn the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of \nlateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- \ntion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test \nand Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, \nultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a \nconfirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted \nby a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants \nwere outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages \n4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- \ntis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients \nwith NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- \ngram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients \nwho are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- \nsia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal \nnerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel \nsyndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, \nthe initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- \njection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy \nintervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral \nelbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 \nIntervention \nInitially, all groups received basic exercise program for four \nweeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by \na physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. \nEquipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one \nkilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a \ntowel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- \ngrams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of \nfour weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- \nical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- \nsion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook \nand were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications \nthere was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- \nration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- \ning physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical \npractice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- \nfession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their \nadvanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two \nexercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. \nAdditionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- \ntient education was given to teach how to act during any work \nactivity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- \nsition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the \nproper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit \nof load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 \nBasic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of \na warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- \noriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were \napplied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- \never, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were \nallowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing \nprocess. \nAdvanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, \nwe determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- \nening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might \ncreate discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four \nweeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that \nthese exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After \nbasic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- \nening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- \ntients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- \ntion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor \nmuscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times \na day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- \nening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- \nband according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises \nexisting in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with \nconcentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- \ntients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- \nother four weeks. \nOutcome measurement \nPain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the \nlevel of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and \ngrip strength measurement.
