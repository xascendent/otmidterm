What Dimitrios say about heavy slow resistance program for elbow pain?,"['Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition that is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- condyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- tis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis. The definitions referring epicondylitis and periositis are discontinued over time. These descriptions were likely indicated an inflamma- tory origin. 2 , 3 Under chronic conditions, the affected tissue gen- erally lacked inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils). 4 In chronic cases, the problem was often degenera- tion origined and angiofibroblastic hyperplasia was the proof of immature tissue repair. For this reason, the term lateral epicondyli- tis may be revised as lateral elbow tendinopathy. 5 Range-of-motion (ROM) exercises, stretching, strengthening, and functional exercises are advised to be included in the treat- ment programs according to the current literature. 5 Stretching ex- ercises cause elongation in the muscle-tendon unit. However, it is still unknown whether the stretching should be static or ballistic, also the issue of selection in isometric or isotonic strengthening exercises still persists in this area. 1 , 2 Viswas et al claimed that ec- centric exercises were better for pain management and function- ality in tendinopathies. 6 Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow resistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric exercises. It is hypothesized to be more beneficial than only eccen- tric training in management of pain and function in LET. 7 All the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- der to carry out the activities of daily living. Otherwise, upper ex- tremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- rioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, there isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about the management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. In the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be modified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- tients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an appropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in movement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints which in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the pain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we planned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised graded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- sue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our exercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded manner. 8 In the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric strengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively named as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program is decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS activity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise program consists of stretching along with both concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more benefit would be obtained because of the transition between two grades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of patients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine the effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- tus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table 2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured advanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- tensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol.']",Dimitrios advocated for the heavy slow resistance program which includes both concentric and eccentric exercises.

What is the Minimal Clinical Important Difference for VAS Score aimed for in the progression of patients with lateral epicondylitis?,"['Materials and methods A prospective case series study was conducted on patients with LET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- thorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- matology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- nations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. They signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the ethical committee of a Public Hospital. Patients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between 30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this diagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast a year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. In the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- tion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test and Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, ultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a confirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted by a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants were outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages 4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- tis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients with NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- gram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients who are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- sia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal nerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel syndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, the initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- jection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy intervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral elbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11 Intervention Initially, all groups received basic exercise program for four weeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by a physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. Equipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one kilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a towel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- grams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of four weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- ical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- sion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook and were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications there was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- ration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- ing physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical practice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- fession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their advanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two exercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. Additionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- tient education was given to teach how to act during any work activity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- sition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the proper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit of load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 Basic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of a warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- oriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were applied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- ever, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were allowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing process. Advanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, we determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- ening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might create discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four weeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that these exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After basic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- ening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- tients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- tion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor muscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times a day with 10 repetitions. The concentric and eccentric strength- ening exercises were started with the use of a dumbell or thera- band according to the capabilities of patients. Warm-up exercises existing in basic protocol were replaced by stretching, along with concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises (Appendix A). Pa- tients have continued their re-structured exercise program for an- other four weeks.']","At the end of four weeks of basic treatment, a three-unit decrease (Minimal Clinical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progression.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

Who Altan et al?,"['Outcome measurement Pain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the level of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and grip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- formed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, during rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with zero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 Pain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a Baseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- terprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear response to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 lb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants at the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- der at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, and hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were taken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of pain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 Level of function Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- ple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- tion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral epicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- lished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 and was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The Turkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- ported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. The first part includes five questions investigating the pain status and the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of function in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) during the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a 0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE scores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P (pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. Grip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- ton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter was adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The diameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society of Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip strength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow at an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- ues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used in the analyses. 22 Statistical analyses All the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- age for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). NPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after each grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was found to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was used for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used for statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises comparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect size was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES of 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of the analysis results.']",Altan et al reported high reliability and validity for the Turkish version of the PRTEE in 2010.,single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
