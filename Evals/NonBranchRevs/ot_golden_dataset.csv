What is the main focus of the supervised graded exercise plan for patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy?,"['All the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- der to carry out the activities of daily living.

In the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be modified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- tients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an appropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in movement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints which in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the pain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we planned a graded exercise model.

"How was the effectiveness of the basic exercise protocol on pain, functional status, and grip strength determined in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy?","['<1-hop>\n\nOutcome measurement Pain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the level of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and grip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- formed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, during rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with zero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 Pain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a Baseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- terprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear response to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 lb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants at the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- der at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, and hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were taken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of pain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 Level of function Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- ple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- tion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral epicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- lished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 and was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The Turkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- ported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. The first part includes five questions investigating the pain status and the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of function in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) during the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a 0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE scores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P (pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. Grip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- ton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter was adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The diameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society of Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip strength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow at an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- ues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used in the analyses. 22 Statistical analyses All the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- age for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). NPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after each grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was found to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was used for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used for statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises comparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect size was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES of 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of the analysis results. Results Thirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion.

In the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be modified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- tients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an appropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in movement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints which in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the pain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we planned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised graded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- sue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our exercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded manner. 8 In the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric strengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively named as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program is decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS activity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise program consists of stretching along with both concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more benefit would be obtained because of the transition between two grades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of patients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine the effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- tus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table 2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured advanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- tensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol. Materials and methods A prospective case series study was conducted on patients with LET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- thorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- matology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- nations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. They signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the ethical committee of a Public Hospital. Patients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between 30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this diagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast a year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. In the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- tion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test and Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, ultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a confirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted by a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants were outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages 4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- tis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients with NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- gram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients who are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- sia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal nerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel syndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, the initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- jection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy intervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral elbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11']","The outcome measurement of pain and function in the study on lateral elbow tendinopathy was conducted using various methods. Pain was measured using the Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) during rest, activity, and at night, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) at the lateral epicondyle, and the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire. The level of function was determined using the PRTEE questionnaire, which consists of questions assessing pain status and level of function in daily and usual activities.

"How was the effectiveness of the basic exercise protocol on pain, functional status, and grip strength determined in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy?","['<1-hop>\n\nOutcome measurement Pain was measured by VAS, Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), the level of function determined with the PRTEE Questionnaire, and grip strength measurement. The outcome measurements were per- formed at baseline, after basic, and two exercise programs. Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain intensity was assessed with VAS, during rest, activity and at night (0-10 visual analog scale, with zero as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain). 12 Pain Pressure Threshold: The pain was measured by using a Baseline 1200-304 system (Push-Pull Force Gauge; Fabrication En- terprises, Inc). The handheld pressure algometer enables a linear response to force application between 0 and 10 kg (22lbs Ã— 1/4 lb and 10 kgs Ã— 100 gm). The PPT was assessed in all participants at the lateral epicondyle. 15 The patient was sitting with the shoul- der at 300 abduction, the elbow at 90 Â° flexion; the forearm, wrist, and hand supported on the table. Three measurements of PPT were taken as the amount of pressure required to elicit a sensation of pain, distinct from pressure sensation. 16 Level of function Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): PRTEE is a sim- ple, reliable, and valid form for the evaluation of pain and func- tion that is specifically oriented for patients diagnosed with lateral epicondylosis. 17 , 18 The tool was developed by MacDermid and pub- lished with reliability statistics in 1999, 19 had an update in 2005, 20 and was independently evaluated by Rompe et al in 2007. 21 The Turkish version demonstrated high reliability and validity as re- ported by Altan et al in 2010. 22 The tool consists of two subscales. The first part includes five questions investigating the pain status and the second part involves 10 questions investigating the level of function in both daily (four items) and usual activities (six items) during the previous week. The symptoms are inquired by using a 0-10 numeric pain rating. 21 In our study, we calculated total PRTEE scores as well as subscales of PRTEE score that include PRTEE-P (pain) and PRTEE-F (function) scores. Grip Strength Measurement: A hand-held dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer; Fabrication Enterprises Inc, Irving- ton, NY) was used for the measurement. The handle of the meter was adjusted in the position, as advised by Mathiowetz et al. 23 The diameter of the dynamometer is 1,5 inches. The American Society of Hand Therapists proposed a standardized arm position for grip strength evaluation described as the shoulder in adduction, elbow at an angle of 90 Â° flexion, and wrist in neutral. 23 , 24 The mean val- ues of three evaluations (kilograms force) were recorded and used in the analyses. 22 Statistical analyses All the data was evaluated using SPSS (the Statistical Pack- age for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistics were analyzed (frequency, mean and standard deviation). NPS was given as a percentage value before treatment and after each grade of exercise. Before the statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of data. Collected data was found to be normally distributed and thus a parametric test was used for the statistical analysis. Paired sample t tests were used for statistical analysis of the before- after basic and two exercises comparisons for pain level, muscle strength, and function. Effect size was separately calculated for each phase of treatment. 25 ES of 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all of the analysis results. Results Thirty-four patients were evaluated for possible inclusion. Thirty patients meeting with inclusion criteria of the study were included. At baseline, 13 of 30 patients belonged to the stage four, nine of 30 patients belonged to stage five and eight of 30 patients belonged to stage six according to NPS LET stages. After basic exer- cise distribution of patientsâ€™ stages according to NPS were changed respectively to values zero (one participant), one (one participants), two (four participants), three (13 participants), four (nine partici- pants), five (two participants). Advanced exercise progression was not planned for two people who took place, they were stage one and two according to NPS due to the lack of symptoms after basic exercises, as not to affect the distribution of results in the study ( Fig. 1 ) [ https://www.nirschl.com/elbow-tendinosis/ ]. Twenty-eight patients were re-assessed after basic exercise program to recruit in the advanced exercise program. After advanced exercises, dis- tribution of patientsâ€™ pain stages according to NPS was changed to respectively to values zero (three participants), one (two par- ticipants), two (11 participants), three (12 participants). The demo- graphic data of the participants are presented in Table 1 . The mean age and body mass index were similar in both groups, also all the participants were right-handed. According to the pain in VAS and in PPT scores, after basic exercise, patients had a lower score than before treatment in- dicating improvement (VAS-Activity p > 0.001, ES = 1.35; VAS- Rest p = 0.007, ES = 0.72; VAS-night p > 0.001, ES = 0.73; PPT p = 0.002, ES = 0.91). Additionally, a significant decrease in VAS and PPT scores were found after advanced exercise in patients with LET (VAS-Activity p = 0.005, ES = 1.73; VAS-Rest p = 0.01, ES = 1.00; VAS-Night p = 0.01, ES = 1.03; PPT p = 0.002', '<2-hop>\n\nAll the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- der to carry out the activities of daily living.
