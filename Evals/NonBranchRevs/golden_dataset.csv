What is the correct term for lateral elbow tendinopathy?,"['Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a kind of soft tissue condition that is affecting 1%-3% of population. 1 Pain around the lateral epi- condyle has variety of names including epicondylalgia, epicondyli- tis, periostitis, and tendinosis of Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis.

What is SpaceX and how does it relate to the field of physical therapy?,"['All the upper quadrant muscles should properly function in or- der to carry out the activities of daily living.

However, there isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about the management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. In the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be modified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- tients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an appropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in movement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints which in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the pain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we planned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised graded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- sue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our exercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded manner. 8 In the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric strengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively named as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program is decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS activity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise program consists of stretching along with both concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more benefit would be obtained because of the transition between two grades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of patients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine the effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- tus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table 2 ).

Otherwise, upper ex- tremity problems like lateral elbow tendinopathy may cause dete- rioration of the function and decrease in quality of life. However, there isnâ€™t any specific exercise protocol in the literature about the management of LET as it exists in shoulder and knee injuries. In the literature it was emphasized that the exercises should be modified to the tolerance and the capability of the patients. 7 Pa- tients with LET may have difficulty in performing exercises in an appropriate manner due to pain. The pain causes alterations in movement strategies and postural deviations, affecting other joints which in turn causes functional disability in time. To avoid the pain-related inactivity during the early stages of the disease, we planned a graded exercise model. The main focus of our supervised graded exercise plan revolves around the pain tolerance and tis- sue healing process. This regulation enables us to re-structure our exercise program accordingly with patientsâ€™ tolerance in a graded manner. 8 In the beginning, a program including warm-up, isometric strengthening, and functionally oriented exercises are collectively named as basic protocol. The transition to the advanced program is decided with the symptomatic feedback and the change in VAS activity scores, inquired during basic exercises. Advanced exercise program consists of stretching along with both concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises. It was hypothesized that more benefit would be obtained because of the transition between two grades of exercises, which is planned accordingly with tolerance of patients with LET. The primary aim of our study; was to determine the effectiveness of basic exercise protocol on pain, functional sta- tus, grip strength and the change in Nirschl Pain Scale (NPS) ( Table 2 ). Secondary aim was to reveal the effects of the re-structured advanced exercise protocol on these parameters after the pain in- tensity was reduced as a result of the basic exercise protocol. Materials and methods A prospective case series study was conducted on patients with LET. Patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit of the au- thorsâ€™ institution from the Department of Orthopedics and Trau- matology of a University. They received written and verbal expla- nations about the procedures of the study protocol to be applied. They signed informed consent forms, which were approved by the ethical committee of a Public Hospital. Patients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged between 30 and 50 years due to this range being the most common for this diagnosis, and all had a prior LET diagnosis. 9 , 10 There was atleast a year before the last treatmet received for LET for all participants. In the clinic where our research was conducted, the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis is made by anamnesis and clinical examina- tion. Typical pain location, spread and special tests (Cozen Test and Mills Test) are applied by the orthopedist and, if necessary, ultrasound imaging is done and sent to the PT department with a confirmed diagnosis. These diagnostic procedures were conducted by a single doctor for the duration of the study. The participants were outlined in Figure 1 . The patients were between the stages 4-6 of NPS ( Fig. 2 ). All patients diagnosed with lateral epicondyli- tis between NPS stages 4-6 were referred to the clinic, patients with NPS stages 1 through 3 are referred for a home exercise pro- gram. Electrotherapy and injection protocol is applied to patients who are in stage 7 of NPS. The exclusion criteria were neopla- sia, pregnancy, neurologic deficits, cervical radiculopathy, periferal nerve disease, rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder disease, radial tunnel syndrome, previous surgery of the affected upper extremities, con-genital or acquired bone deformity in ipsilateral upper extremity, the initiation of opioid analgesia or corticosteroid or analgesic in- jection interventions within the previous year, any physical therapy intervention on the upper extremity in the previous year, bilateral elbow tendinopathy and secondary orthopedics problems. 11']","The graded exercise model helps in the management of lateral elbow tendinopathy by focusing on pain tolerance and tissue healing process, allowing for a structured exercise program based on patient tolerance.

How does the supervised graded exercise plan for lateral elbow tendinopathy focus on pain tolerance and tissue healing process in the context of upper extremity problems?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIntervention Initially, all groups received basic exercise program for four weeks, three times a week. Exercises were evaluated monthly by a physiotherapist; all complaints and suggestions were recorded. Equipment required for the exercises were elastic finger band, one kilogram weight or an equivalent dumbell, hand exercise ball and a towel. The physiotherapist checked and revised their exercise pro- grams according to the change of VAS-Activity scores. At the end of four weeks of basic treatment, three-unit decrease (Minimal Clin- ical Important Difference for VAS Score) was aimed for progres- sion. 12 For home exercises, patients were provided with a logbook and were asked to log all their exercises. For clinical applications there was constant physiotherapist supervision for the entire du- ration, there was no specific qualifications required for the provid- ing physiotherapist other than a minimum of five years in clinical practice, due to the exercises being under the definition of the pro- fession. The participants who fulfilled these criteria continued their advanced exercises for another four weeks. Both the basic and two exercises were conducted for four weeks, for a total of 12 sessions. Additionally, at the beginning of an exercise program, a brief pa- tient education was given to teach how to act during any work activity or computer use. The maintenance of the neutral wrist po- sition, especially avoiding the palm down position, along with the proper usage of the two-handed position and a two-kilogram limit of load per hand during any carrying activities were emphasized. 13 Basic Exercise Program: Basic exercise program consisted of a warm-up, isometric strengthening exercise and functionally- oriented exercises which adapt to the patients daily activities were applied three times daily with 10 repetitions. 14 (Appendix A). How- ever, neither stretching nor isotonic strengthening exercises were allowed in the basic rehabilitation, so as not to disrupt the healing process. Advanced Exercise Program: During prior clinical observations, we determined that the stretching exercises and isotonic strength- ening exercises, including both concentric and eccentric, might create discomfort and/or irritating sensation during the first four weeks of the rehabilitation. 14 For this reason, it was decided that these exercises were not appropriate for the basic protocol. After basic exercises were terminated, stretching and isotonic strength- ening exercises are used to retrain in the bearable limits with pa- tients for another four weeks. Stretching for wrist extension mo- tion was applied daily with five repetitions. For wrist extensor muscle, eccentric strengthening exercises were practiced two times a day with 10 repetitions.
