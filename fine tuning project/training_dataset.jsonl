Research has suggested that joint mobilizations may help recover patients \nwith lateral epicondylitis. \nPurpose of the Study: To determine if wrist joint manipulations effectively improve pain, grip strength, \nROM, and functional outcome in adults with lateral epicondylitis. \nMethods: Searches were performed in 6 databases to identify relevant clinical trials. Three reviewers in- \ndependently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Standard data \nwere extracted and summarized.", "63a8bc06-2937-4de4-9e53-55fd69b397b4": "Results: A total of 4 studies met the inclusion criteria. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize \nthe results. The included studies found effectiveness in favor of wrist manipulations given for at least \n3 weeks to reduce pain in lateral epicondylitis against comparison groups comprising ultrasound, laser, \nfriction massage, and exercises. Functional outcomes varied considerably among studies.
